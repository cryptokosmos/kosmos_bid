# kosmos_bid
This project defines the rules that how to ‘buy’ the data of kosmos. The user could only buy the data usage rights. The data is ALWAYS belong to data contributors.
  KOSMOS data purchaser rules:
1. The official only considers the selling mechanism of primary data 
2. After each block is generated, vickery auction rule (the second-price sealed-bid Auction)  is used for bidding. The base price is the number of tokens included in the block. The auction deadline is the time when the sixth block is generated.
The user who takes a block gets all the subsequent revenue generated by the block. 
If fail to sell，the system will automatically obtains all the subsequent income generated by the block.
3. The data revenue mechanism is designed by a third party, such as the third party DMP. KOSMOS will provide a complete support mechanism and confirmation mechanism to ensure the convenience of third-party development and rights of data owners. This mechanism is only used for supporting ecological development. It does not endorse any third-party development.
4. The proceeds go into the KOSMOS subsidy pool and shared by data contributors eventually. However, the block data gets the users’ subsequent revenue. It won’t be shared.
